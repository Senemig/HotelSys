## Hotel Room Management System Project

Simple room management system made as a project to sharpen my skills with C# and ASP.NET MVC. With this WebApp you can:

- Register a Client to the Data Base;
- Browse through the Clients in the Data Base;
- Browse through the Rooms in the Data Base;
- Get information about the Rooms (what kind of beds, how many beds, if they have TV, etc);
- See Room availability;
- Check In/Check Out;
- Book a Room (In Progress);
